## What is Monolithic Architecture?

A **monolithic architecture** is a traditional model where the **entire application (frontend, backend, and business logic)** is built and deployed as a **single unit**.

### ⚙️ How It Works

1. The user sends a request (e.g., `/login`).
2. The server receives the request, processes it (controllers → services → models).
3. The response is sent back to the user — all inside one big application.

✅ Advantages

- **Simple to develop** (especially for small teams or projects)
- **Easy to test** and run locally
- **Single deployment** (only one file/package to deploy)
- **Straightforward debugging** — since all code is in one place

---

### ❌ Disadvantages

- **Tight coupling** — one module affects others
- **Hard to scale** — can’t scale parts independently
- **Slow build & deployment time** — even small changes require redeploying the whole app
- **Limited flexibility** — hard to adopt new technologies per module
- **Maintenance issues** — becomes complex as the app grows (the “big ball of mud” problem)

## What is Mirco Service Architecture ?

**Microservices architecture** is a **modern software design approach** where a large application is divided into **small, independent services** — and each service handles **one specific feature or business function**.

Each microservice:

- Runs on its **own process**
- Has its **own database (usually)**
- Communicates with others through **APIs (mostly REST or GraphQL)**

### ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Client** sends a request (e.g., place an order).
2. Request goes through the **API Gateway**.
3. Gateway routes the request to the **appropriate service**:
    - `auth-service` verifies the user.
    - `order-service` creates an order.
    - `payment-service` processes payment.
    - `notification-service` sends a confirmation mail.
4. Services communicate internally via **HTTP**, **gRPC**, or **message queues** (like Kafka or RabbitMQ).

### ✅ Advantages

1. **Scalability** – you can scale only the service that needs more resources
    
    (e.g., scale `product-service` if traffic is high there).
    
2. **Independent deployment** – deploy or update one service without affecting others.
3. **Technology flexibility** – different services can use different programming languages or databases.
4. **Faster development** – small teams can work independently on different services.
5. **Fault isolation** – if one service fails, others keep running.

---

### ❌ Disadvantages

1. **Complex communication** between services.
2. **Deployment and management** are harder — you need proper orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes).
3. **Data consistency** issues — each service has its own database.
4. **Debugging/tracing** across multiple services can be difficult.
5. **Higher initial setup** cost and effort.
